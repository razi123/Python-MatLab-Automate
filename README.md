# Python-MatLab-Automate


This code selects multiple folder and video files in order to load into the virtual dub
we cannot select all folders at once because MatLab doesnâ€™t have any such command but we can select folders each and then extract the required files from the folder
It goes like this:
1.  First a GUI window pops-up, open the directory where the videos are located 
2.  Select a folder or if it contains subfolder then select them
3.  After this it will redirect to the root folder from where you should select the same folder/subfolders which is selected in the step2
4.  This time it will show all the files and images in the folders/ subfolder
5.  Select images required and click ok.
